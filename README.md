# Atul Arun - Portfolio Website

Hey there! This is my personal portfolio website that I built to showcase my journey in Software Engineering and Data & Business Intelligence. What makes this project special? I developed the entire thing using AI assistance - specifically Cursor AI and some pretty efficient prompting techniques. It's been quite the adventure!

## My AI Development Journey

So here's the cool part - I built this entire portfolio using **AI as my coding partner**. It's been an amazing experience working with Cursor AI and learning how to craft really effective prompts. Think of it as having a super-smart coding buddy who helps you turn ideas into reality faster than ever.

### AI Tools Used
- **Cursor AI**: Primary development environment with AI assistance
- **Efficient Prompting**: Strategic use of clear, specific prompts for optimal results
- **Iterative Development**: Continuous refinement through AI feedback loops

### My Development Philosophy
I believe the future of coding is **human creativity + AI efficiency**. I handle the big picture ideas and creative decisions, while AI helps me prototype quickly and handle the repetitive stuff. It's the best of both worlds!

## What You'll Find Here

### The Look & Feel
- **Dark Theme**: Because who doesn't love a sleek dark interface? Dark blue with teal accents - it just looks professional
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on your phone, tablet, laptop, or whatever device you're using
- **Smooth Animations**: Little touches that make the experience feel polished
- **Constellation Loading**: My favorite part - a beautiful starry loading screen that sets the mood

## The Tech Stack

### What I Used
- **HTML5**: Clean, semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Grid, Flexbox, and some pretty cool animations
- **JavaScript**: For all the interactive stuff
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
